 🎥 **PrimeVision: An AI-Powered Streaming Platform**

**PrimeVision** is a full-stack web application that reimagines what it takes to build a **modern, intelligent streaming service** from scratch. 🚀
It’s not just another movie library — it’s a **smart, AI-driven platform** that understands your preferences and helps you discover what to watch next 🎯.

## 💡 **Why I Built This (The Problem)**

In today’s digital world, we have *endless choices* — but choosing what to watch is still a struggle 😅.
So, I built **PrimeVision** to solve that exact problem using a **personalized recommendation system** that *learns from the user’s behavior*.

This project was my opportunity to explore:

* 🔧 **Full-stack development** from scratch
* 🤖 **AI implementation** in a real-world product
* 🧠 **User-centered design** for a smarter viewing experience

The goal? → To build a complete application that handles everything:
from **user authentication** and **data persistence** to **AI-based recommendations** that truly enhance how people find content. 🎬

## ⚙️ **How It Works (The Implementation)**

PrimeVision is built with a clear separation between the **frontend** and **backend**, ensuring clean architecture and scalability.

### 🧠 **The Recommendation Engine (The "AI")**

At the heart of PrimeVision lies the **Content-Based Filtering Algorithm** — the brain that drives your movie recommendations.

Here’s how it works step by step:

1. 🔍 **Analysis:** When a user interacts with a movie, the system studies its key properties — especially its **genres**.
2. 🧩 **Scoring:** It compares that movie’s attributes with every other title in the database to calculate a **similarity score**.
3. 📊 **Ranking:** Movies are then ranked and displayed, showing the ones you’re **most likely to love next** ❤️.

This approach gives every user a **unique, data-driven experience** that evolves with their viewing history.

### 🔐 **Building a Personalized & Persistent Experience**

PrimeVision isn’t just smart — it remembers you. 🧠💾
All user data is securely stored and managed through **MongoDB**, creating a seamless experience across sessions.

Key personalization features include:

* 🪪 **User Authentication:**
  Sign up and log in via **email/password** or **Google OAuth 2.0**, with secure **JWT (JSON Web Token)** session management.

* 📁 **Saved Recommendations:**
  Your last generated recommendations are always ready for you when you return.

* 🎞️ **Watch History:**
  Automatically logs your activity so you can easily *continue watching* from where you left off.

* ⭐ **Favourites List:**
  Keep track of your favorite movies and shows in one personalized list that persists across devices.
